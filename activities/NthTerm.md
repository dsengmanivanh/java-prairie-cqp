### Sum of the first nth term of Series
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).<br/>

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...

Rules:<br/>
You need to round the answer upto 2 decimal places and return it as String.<br/>
If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00.<br/>
You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.<br/>
Examples:<br/>

SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1"<br/>
SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"<br/>
SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"<br/>

Implement and test NthSeries<br/>
